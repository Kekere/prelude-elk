# ------------------------------------ Logs ------------------------------------
#
# The section below defines a mapping between the fields recognized by Prelude
# and the fields defined in the logs index(es) of the Elasticsearch cluster.

# Fields must only use alphanumeric chars, "_" or "-" and must not start with "-".

# The first value is the field used during regular searches.
# The second value is the field used for aggregation.
# If omitted, it defaults to the first value.
