DEVELOPMENT
###########

This file contains quick instructions to help with development.


Test locally
============

Development mode
----------------

  make run ENVIRONMENT=dev

Test published images
---------------------

  make run


Rebuild & tag a new image
=========================

  make build ENVIRONMENT=dev VERSION=X.Y

Note: the newly-built image will also be tagged "latest" automatically.


Push images
===========

  make push VERSION=X.Y

This will push both the images tagged with the "X.Y" and "latest" versions.
If VERSION is omitted, only this command only pushes the "latest" versions.


Cleanup
=======

  make clean

This will try to clean containers & images created automatically by
docker-compose.

You may also want to run:

  docker image prune -a

to also remove unused images.
